These expressions are fundamental in programming and data science, enabling us to perform tasks like basic arithmetic, mathematical modeling, and data analysis. In this section, we will explore some common examples of arithmetic expressions.\n\n### Basic Arithmetic Operators\n\nArithmetic expressions typically include the following basic operators:\n- **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers.\n- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one number from another.\n- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.\n- **Division (/)**: Divides one number by another.\n- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.\n- **Exponentiation (**) **: Raises a number to the power of another.\n\n### Example 1: Addition\n```python\nresult = 5 + 3  # Adds 5 and 3\nresult = 10 - 4  # Subtracts 4 from 10\nresult = 6 * 7  # Multiplies 6 by 7\nresult = 20 / 4  # Divides 20 by 4\nresult = 17 % 5  # Returns the remainder of 17 divided by 5\nresult = 2 ** 3  # Raises 2 to the power of 3 (2^3)\n",
